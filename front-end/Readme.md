We use React Native for the front-end. There is no reason why you can't build your own front-end with other existing technologies. We are just more familiar with React Native so we decided to go with it. This has the nice advantage that this web-app also works as mobile app and could be potentially submitted to the App Store or Play Store.

## Libraries

Below you will find a list of the main libraries we use for the Project alongside a short description on what they do

- NativeBase: This our UI template library. They provide components such as Input, Button, etc. which already have styling applied to them and work out the box on Web & Native
- React Navigation
- Expo
